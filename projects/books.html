          <h2>Catalysts for Awareness</h2>

            <p class="space">Literature contains knowledge, knowledge that possesses the power to catalyze paradigm shifts in our world. How we see our surroundings can be influenced the books that we choose to savor. We have the power to seek out books that question the way that we were raised, the cultures that we were each born into, and the social constructs that surround us every day. Below are select books that have prompted me to radically reevaluate the world, diving into what I have taken for granted, including our inherent freedom to vote, to "safety", and to white privilege. I will add to the list as I find strong words and welcome all recommendations! There is a section at the end for what is on the reading docket and suggestions from you.

          <h2>Scientific and Environmental</h2>

            <p><b>Braiding Sweetgrass </b> <i>by Robin Wall Kimmerer</i> |
            An eloquent compilation of stories and accounts of traditional wisdom about the natural world told by a scientist. Together, she weaves scientific findings with inherent lessons from nature that has been lost generationally. We have lost touch with the ways that our world provides for us, and our responsibility to care for the Earth that provides us with everything. Relearning what was once lost can allow for the betterment of not only the planet but of ourselves therein.
            </p>

            <p><b>Women Who Run with the Wolves </b> <i>by Clarissa Pinkola Estes</i> |

            <p><b>Founding Sisters</b> <i>by Eleanor Cliff </i> |
              This book marches you through the treacherous 50 or more years that women fought for the right to vote. It tells of the pushback that they received from presidents, men, and women alike - women who didn't want to have more responsibility at the time than they already had. It's remarkable to see how women suppressed blacks in order to gain the vote of a white man, how times of war trumped changing the very infrastructure of our nation while we fought for other freedom in other nations. The book reveals how women were thrown in jail for picketing, how they united to resist unjustified jail sentences via hunger strikes, and were force fed in jails. It's remarkable how much was sacrificed for our right to vote, one that we take lightly and usually find an excuse to avoid heading the polls.
            </p>

            <p><b>Taking Charge of Your Fertility</b> <i>by Toni Weschler </i> |
              This book empowers women and men through a deeper anatomic understanding of the female body. The female body has been manipulated throughout history, whether it be through religion, social expectations, or career paths, we are often taught through these forms that we have no real power over our bodies. Hormonal contraception is one form where the initial intention was not of empowerment, although many women perceive it today to be so. This book does an excellent job of painting a method of natural regulation of the female body through understanding natural temperature cycles. Moreover, it creates a deeper relationship with yourself.
