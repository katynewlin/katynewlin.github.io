							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/IMG_6160.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								I am currently a Research Scholar conducting a year-long field study to collect samples and data towards creating sustainable agricultural platforms. I have doctorate in Chemical Engineering from
								the University of Houston after  which I moved to Boston for a postdoctoral
								 position at MIT with Bob Langer and Dan Anderson. Following
								 these academic adventures, I worked alongside teams to
								 formulate extended release therapeutics at Alkermes, a
								 pharmaceutical company, to address opioid addiction,
								 Alzheimerâ€™s, and Schizophrenia.</p>

								 <p>I am an expert at harnessing molecular
 								interactions to tune material properties for the design of
 								therapeutics and bioscaffolds to solve health challenges. I am tenacious, curious, and have an
							 insatiable appetite for procuring questions and seeking answers
							 to fundamental science.</p>

 							  <p>I am exploring fundamental questions to create
								 solutions for a sustainable future where there
								 are none. I invite you to join us, to brainstorm, to share
								your experiences, to evoke the sensation of growing into
								something more than ourselves by exploring natural phenomena. A continual manifestation of
								ideas that allow us to move beyond social normalcy and explore
								the abnormalities that bring us to life, a life that exceeds
								our very expectations.</p>
