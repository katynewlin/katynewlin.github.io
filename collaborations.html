							<h3>Katy N. Newlin</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/IMG_6160.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								My name is Katy Newlin. I am tenacious, curious, and have an
								insatiable appetite for procuring questions and seeking answers
								to fundamental science. I am an expert at harnessing molecular
								interactions to tune material properties for the design of
								therapeutics and bioscaffolds to solve health challenges.</p>

							<p>I am a scientist with a doctorate in Chemical Engineering from
								the University of Houston under Peter Vekilov and Jeffrey Rimer.
								 I then moved to Boston to expand myself with a postdoctoral
								 position at MIT with Bob Langer and Dan Anderson. Following
								 these academic adventures, I worked alongside teams to
								 formulate extended release therapeutics at Alkermes, a
								 pharmaceutical company, to address opioid addiction,
								 Alzheimerâ€™s, and Schizophrenia.</p>

							<p>But I am bigger than this, than the labels that define me as
								there are grander components of the world and people to explore.
								 I am here to redefine what it means to explore fundamental
								 questions that continually intrigue me in order to create
								 solutions for our world for a sustainable future where there
								 are none.</p>

							<p>Welcome to this small slice of my world, to a space where I
								invite you to come alive, to brainstorm with me, to share
								your experiences, to evoke the sensation of growing into
								something more than ourselves. A continual manifestation of
								ideas that allow us to move beyond social normalcy and explore
								the abnormalities that bring us to life, a life that exceeds
								our very expectations.</p>
