							<h2>Katy N. Newlin</h2>

								I am currently on a journey from the United States to Canada, Mexico, and onward through Central and South America. Having spent most of my life in academia, I yearned to deconstruct classic social structures from my life and set out on a journey to see how the world works. I believe that in order to contribute fully, I must first experience the social and industrial infrastructures at play in our world. By first learning how and why people thrive the way that they do, I will broaden my perspectives to hopefully one day intelligently determine how to generate synchronicity with our world and our own actions.
							</p>

							<p>
								Prior to traveling, I lived in the academic world. I am a scientist with a doctorate in Chemical Engineering from the University of Houston where I became an expert at harnessing molecular interactions. I provided guidelines for antimalarial drug design by seeing how malaria parasites operate at a molecular level. After completing graduate school, I moved to Boston, MA for a postdoctoral position at MIT in the Langer Lab. It was there that I worked on reversing Type II Diabetes through the development of colloidal scaffolds for controlling three-dimensional organization of Pancreatic cells. And in the end, I migrated to industry where I worked within teams to formulate controlled, extended release therapeutics to address opioid addiction, Alzheimerâ€™s, and Schizophrenia.
							</p>

 							<p>
								Here, I invite you to brainstorm or to share your experiences with an effort to grow into something more than what we are right now. I aspire to continually manifest ideas that allow us to move beyond social normalcy and explore the abnormalities that bring us to life, a life that exceeds our very expectations. Feel free to reach out and start a conversation! I would love to hear from you or meet you along the way as we travel the Americas.
